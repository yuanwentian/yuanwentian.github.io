## About me

Currently, I am an undergraduate research assistant advised by [Prof. Tao Gao](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~taogao/) in [VCLA lab](http://vcla.stat.ucla.edu/index.html) at UCLA. Previously, I was a research assistant in EPIC Lab at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, advised by [Prof. Min Chen](http://mmlab.snu.ac.kr/~mchen/). I will receive a B.E. degree in Electrical Engineering and Automtion from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in June, 2019.

## Research interests

Aritificial intelligence, though soaring, are still far from human intelligence in generic level. 
Inspired by my interdisciplinary research experience. My research interests lie in a combination with Robotic Manipulation and Cognitive Science. 
My research interests focus on the difference between human intelligence and machine intelligence, to cognitive models to help design robots that can seamless collaborate with human beings.

### 3. Emotion Communication and Affective Interaction System

In this project, a prototype system for emotion detection and interaction is designed. The emotion detection and interaction system are closely related to the user’s characteristics, so the robot design used the IoT framework to fetch needed information. The system adopted an audio-visual information-based method to collect the multimodal data. The main emotion data were user’s facial images and voices. The audio-visual information-based method had the advantages of high-accuracy recognition and low-overhead computation.

### 4. Cognitive Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks
 With the prosperous development of artificial intelligence, cloud/edge computing and 5G network slicing, a more intelligent vehicular network is under deliberation. In this project, we propose an innovative paradigm called Cognitive Internet Ad Hoc Networks to fully realize future autonomous driving scenarios. Different from existing works, which mainly focus on communication technologies, CIoV enhances transportation safety and network security by mining effective information from both physical and network data space.
