## About me

Currently, I am an undergraduate research assistant advised by [Prof. Tao Gao](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~taogao/) in [VCLA lab](http://vcla.stat.ucla.edu/index.html) at UCLA. Previously, I was a research assistant in EPIC Lab at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, advised by [Prof. Min Chen](http://mmlab.snu.ac.kr/~mchen/). I will receive a B.E. degree in Electrical Engineering and Automtion from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in June, 2019.

## Research interests
> The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing.                       ---Albert Einstein

The beauty of human mind never ceases to amaze me. Unlike artificial intelligence, human intelligence never trys to converge to one point, but instead, develops into multiple possiblities, let alone how efficient and accurate it can be. Inspired by my research experience, my research interests lie in an interdisciplinary area with Artificial Intelligence, Robotic Manipulation and Cognitive Science.

*   Artificial Intelligence: reinforcement learning, multi-agent system, autonomous driving.
*   Robotic Manipulation: motion planning, signal processing, control and optimization.
*   Cognitive Science: How to use mathematics as an expression of the human mind to reflect the active will and the contemplative reason.

### Physical-Mind Joint Inference System
How does human interpret a visual system? Based on Prof. Tao Gao's previous research work "chasing attention animacy", in this project, we further explore how human understand and infer the function of system. The result shows that tells human can better understand the system in pyhsical-mind joint inference perspective. Can you quickly detect the system relationship in the left demo? How about the right demo with the system constraint (tendon）visiable? （The system relationship are intended to simulate a dog chasing a rabbit but being dragged by a human.)

### Model-Based Trajectory Planning through Generic Nonlinear Programming
In this project, we build a model-­based trajectory planning library using CMake and C++, the idea is to implement robotic motion planning with constraints using MuJoCo (Multi­ Joint dynamics with Contact) physics engine and IPOPT (Interior Point OPTimizer) solver. We evaluated our trajectory planning library on two task scenarios (random­-target and collision­-free) and three models (inverted pendulum, inverted double pendulum and cart pole).
