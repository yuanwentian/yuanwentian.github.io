###  Emotion Communication and Affective Interaction System

In this project, a prototype system for emotion detection and interaction is designed. The emotion detection and interaction system are closely related to the user’s characteristics, so the robot design used the IoT framework to fetch needed information. The system adopted an audio-visual information-based method to collect the multimodal data. The main emotion data were user’s facial images and voices. The audio-visual information-based method had the advantages of high-accuracy recognition and low-overhead computation.

###  Cognitive Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks
 With the prosperous development of artificial intelligence, cloud/edge computing and 5G network slicing, a more intelligent vehicular network is under deliberation. In this project, we propose an innovative paradigm called Cognitive Internet Ad Hoc Networks to fully realize future autonomous driving scenarios. Different from existing works, which mainly focus on communication technologies, CIoV enhances transportation safety and network security by mining effective information from both physical and network data space.
